# SQL-Challenges

Nothing can be more exciting than seeing the results of your learning journey 

I'm delighted to share my solution for Steve's Car Showroom Challenge. I used Microsoft SQL . I used WHERE, GROUP BY, ORDER BY, and LIMIT, YEAR functions to extract the year from the purchase date.

Additionally, I employed aggregate functions like SUM and COUNT and use JOIN syntax to connect the tables.
